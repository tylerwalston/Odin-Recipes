    <h3>Garlic bread so good you could eat it without stopping.</h3>
    <p>This is the garlic bread that is so good you could eat it for every meal, even if bread makes you fat.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 loaf supermarket Italian bread (or any kind of your choice)</li>
        <li>1 stick lightly softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp finely chopped basil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by taking 1 loaf of fresh bread and cutting it in half.</li>
        <li>Place 1 stick of lightly softened unsalted butter into a bowl. Use a garlic press to crush 3 garlic cloves and add them to the bowl. Then, add about 2 tablespoons each of finely chopped basil and parsley to the bowl. Finally, add a generous amount of kosher salt and freshly ground pepper. Mash the mixture into a cohesive paste or otherwise known as compound butter.</li>
        <li>Generously and evenly slather the compound butter on top of both halves of the bread. </li>
        <li>For baking, use one of two methods. Sandwich your bread, wrap it in aluminum foil, and bake at 350°F for about 20 minutes. This method will give you a crisp exterior and soft interior, but it might leave the garlic somewhat uncooked. Alternatively, bake the bread open-faced at 400°F for 7-8 minutes until the bread is crisp and the little chunks of garlic are starting to turn lightly blonde around the edges. </li>
    </ol>
