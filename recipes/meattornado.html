    <h3>You had me at meat tornado.</h3>
    <p>The epic burrito that terrorizes the countryside with its powerful meat winds.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs flank steak</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 bunch cilantro</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, add ¼ cup each of lemon juice, vegetable oil, soy sauce, and chicken stock with ½ teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon of ground cumin, ¼ cup of white sugar, 2 crushed cloves of garlic, a bunch of chopped cilantro, and a tablespoon each of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Whisk together to combine. </li>
        <li>Into a large bowl or pan, place in the 2 lbs of flank steak, and cover with the marinade making sure every inch is evenly coated. Cover and fridge for 4 hours. Flip once or twice through the process. </li>
        <li>After 4 hours of marinating, remove some of the excess herbs and garlic from the steak to prevent burning. </li>
        <li>On a well oiled and preheated cast iron (once wisps of smoke appear), place the flank steak onto the cast iron leaving undisturbed for about 5 minutes until the first side has developed a dark brown char. Flip and repeat. </li>
        <li>If not ready to serve, place into a low heated oven to keep warm until ready to prepare.</li>
    </ol>
